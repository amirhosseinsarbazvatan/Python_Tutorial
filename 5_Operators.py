# Conditional statements in python


# Types of operators in python:

# Arithmetic operators
# Assignment operators
# Comparison operators
# Logical operators




# Arithmetic operators are used with numeric values to perform common mathematical operation
# + - * / // % **

x = 2 + 2
y = 5 * 3
z = 15 // 4


# Assignment operators are used to assign values to variables

x = 5
str = "Python"
Student = True


# Comparison operators are used to compare two values
# == < > <= >= !=
# Result of comparison operators will be True | False

print(5==5)
print(6<10)
print(1<=9)


# Logical operators are used to combine conditional statements
# and => Returns True if both statements are true
# or => Returns True if one of the statements is true
# not => Reverse the result, returns False if the result is true

print(x < 5 and  x < 10)
print(x < 5 or x < 4)
print(not(x < 5 and x < 10))
